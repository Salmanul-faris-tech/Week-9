1. IP Addressing, Subnetting, CIDR, and MAC Addresses
a. IPv4 Addressing Scheme

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) uses a 32-bit address divided into four octets (like 192.168.1.10).
It supports around 4.3 billion unique addresses.

Types of IPv4 Addresses

Public IP: Used on the internet.

Private IP: Used inside local networks. Examples:

10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255

172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255

192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

Loopback IP: 127.0.0.1 (used for testing your own machine)

APIPA: 169.254.x.x (when DHCP fails)

IPv6 Addressing Scheme

IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, written in hexadecimal (example: 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).
It provides an extremely large number of addresses, solving IPv4 exhaustion.

Benefits of IPv6

More address space

Built-in security (IPSec)

Better routing

No need for NAT

Subnetting

Subnetting means dividing a large network into smaller networks to:

Improve security

Reduce broadcast traffic

Enhance network performance

Example:
If you have 192.168.1.0/24, subnetting into two gives:

192.168.1.0/25

192.168.1.128/25

Each new network has fewer hosts, but more control and efficiency.

CIDR Notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

CIDR uses a slash (/) to define how many bits are used for the network.

Example:
192.168.1.10/24

/24 means first 24 bits = network,

remaining 8 bits = hosts.

CIDR helps:

Reduce waste of IP addresses

Create flexible subnet sizes

Improve routing

b. MAC Address

A MAC address (Media Access Control) is a physical address burned into a network card.

Example: A4:B1:C2:09:EF:67

Features

48-bit address

Works on Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)

Unique for every device

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses inside a local network.

Example:
When your device wants to communicate with 192.168.1.5, it must ask:

“Who has this IP? Tell me your MAC address!”

ARP replies with the correct MAC.

Why ARP exists?

Because:

IP works in Layer 3

MAC works in Layer 2

Devices need MAC to communicate inside LAN

MAC Address Spoofing

MAC spoofing means changing your MAC address temporarily or permanently.

Why it is done?

To bypass MAC filtering

To impersonate another device

For penetration testing

For privacy in public Wi-Fi

Security Risk

Attackers can perform:

ARP spoofing

Man-in-the-middle attacks

Network impersonation
