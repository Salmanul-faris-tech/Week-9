2. Research Encryption Protocols & IDS/IPS — Brief Explanation
A. Encryption Protocols (SSL/TLS & IPsec)
1. SSL/TLS

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are encryption protocols used to secure data traveling between a user and a website.

How it works

When you open a website with https://, SSL/TLS encrypts your data.

It protects login details, credit card numbers, and personal information.

Uses certificates to verify the server is genuine.

Strengths

Strong encryption.

Widely used on the internet.

Protects against eavesdropping and tampering.

Provides authentication (server identity).

Weaknesses

If certificates are misconfigured or expired → insecure.

Vulnerable if old versions (SSL 2.0, 3.0) are used.

Relies on trust in Certificate Authorities.

2. IPsec

IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is a protocol suite used to secure network traffic between devices (like between two offices, or a user and a VPN).

How it works

Works at the network layer.

Encrypts all IP packets.

Commonly used in VPNs.

Provides:

Encryption

Authentication

Integrity checking

Strengths

Very secure for site-to-site or remote VPNs.

Protects all traffic, not just browser traffic.

Works automatically without user interaction.

Weaknesses

Complex to configure.

Requires compatible devices on both ends.

Can reduce network performance due to heavy encryption.

B. Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

IDS and IPS are cybersecurity tools that monitor network or system activity.

1. IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
What it does

Monitors traffic or system activities.

Detects suspicious/malicious behavior.

Alerts the admin but does not block the attack.

Types

NIDS (Network IDS) – Monitors network traffic.

HIDS (Host IDS) – Monitors individual devices.

Features

Detects malware, attack patterns, abnormal traffic.

Uses signatures or behavior analysis.

Generates alerts for investigations.

Deployment Considerations

Needs proper tuning to avoid false alarms.

Should be placed where it can monitor network traffic effectively.

Best used for monitoring, not blocking.

2. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
What it does

Detects and blocks malicious activity automatically.

Works inline with traffic (between user and network).

Types

Network IPS

Host IPS

Features

Automatically blocks attacks.

Prevents malware, port scans, DDoS, and exploit attempts.

Can drop packets, reset connections, or quarantine devices.

Deployment Considerations

Must be placed inline → if IPS fails, traffic may be affected.

Needs strong hardware to avoid slowing the network.

Must be configured carefully to avoid blocking legitimate traffic.
