1. ISP (Internet Service Provider)

What it is:
Your ISP is the company that gives you internet access (like Jio, Airtel, BSNL).

How it works:
Every internet request you make goes through your ISP.

Role in privacy & security:

ISPs can see your browsing activity, the websites you visit, and your IP address.

They can track and log your data unless it’s encrypted.

They provide no anonymity — your identity is directly linked to your IP.

2. VPN (Virtual Private Network)

What it is:
A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet.

How it works:

When you use a VPN, your traffic goes to a VPN server first, then to the internet.

Your real IP is hidden, replaced with the VPN server’s IP.

Role in privacy & security:

Encrypts your data, so ISP, hackers, or public Wi-Fi attackers cannot see what you're doing.

Hides your location and IP, improving anonymity.

Protects you on public networks (cafés, airports).

VPN provider can see your traffic, but a good provider does no logging.

3. Proxy

What it is:
A proxy server acts as a middleman between you and the internet.

How it works:

Your requests go to the proxy, and the proxy fetches the data.

Role in privacy & security:

Hides your IP address, similar to VPN, but…

No encryption (except HTTPS proxy).

Mainly used for bypassing restrictions, not strong security.

Good for accessing blocked websites, but not safe on public Wi-Fi.
